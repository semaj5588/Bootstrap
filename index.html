			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/mypic.jpg" class="auth-image">

			<p>Hey my name is James Kim, I graduated from Rutgers with a Bachelor's degree in 2012. I'm currently working for a computer software company called Medidata Solutions. Some of the things I enjoy doing include playing video games, watching movies, going to the gym, and trying out new restaurants.</p>

			<p>My goal is to become a senior web developer one day. I really like my current company so I hope to get a web development role within the company once I complete the bootcamp. I am becoming more and more passionate the more I learn about coding and I hope to gain a lot of experience from this bootcamp. I look forward to the tough (but exciting) times ahead.</p>
